## Introduction

UI testing can become challenging when dealing with complex user interfaces. Traditional solutions like the Page Object Model (POM) may lead to maintenance overhead and code duplication. This project explores a more efficient approach using BDD with cucumber data tables and UI Elements to streamline UI testing.

## Problematic

The project addresses the limitations of the Page Object Model when dealing with complex UIs. It discusses the challenges of maintaining large page objects and handling ever-growing cucumber feature files.

## Possible Solution

After recognizing the drawbacks of the Page Object Model, the project explores an alternative solution. It delves into the concept of UI Elements and explains how they can make UI testing more dynamic, readable, and maintainable.

## UI Elements Explained

This section provides an in-depth explanation of UI Elements - distinct units responsible for interacting with specific UI elements. It covers how UI Elements handle different actions and contribute to enhanced flexibility in UI testing.

## Example of Using UI Elements

A practical example is presented in this section, demonstrating how to use UI Elements with cucumber data tables to test a complex UI scenario. The example showcases the benefits of the approach in making test scenarios more concise and readable.

## Benefits

The Benefits section highlights the advantages of adopting UI Elements for UI testing. It emphasizes how this approach improves test suite maintainability, readability, and scalability.
